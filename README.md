3. Point camera at `incredibles.jpg`
4. Grant camera permissions
5. Watch for the 3D model to appear!

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main AR application
- `incredibles.jpg` - Image target for AR recognition
- `targets.mind` - Trained image recognition data
- `Baby.stl` - 3D model file (needs external hosting)

## Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure HTTPS is used for camera access
- Verify STL file URL is accessible
- Try the fallback models if primary fails
